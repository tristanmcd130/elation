# Elation

Elation is a stack-based concatenative language written in Python. It is very similar to and very much inspired by [Joy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_(programming_language)), the first concatenative language created by Manfred von Thun.

# Usage

Run elation with no arguments to open a REPL. The state of the stack will be displayed after each line. Alternatively, provide a filename as an argument and it will be ran as a script.
